# Advent of Code 2024 Challenge

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge. 
The Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. 
Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants work to solve it using their programming skills.

This repository is organized by day, with each day's solution contained in its own directory. 
Each directory includes README, where the problem is specified, necessary scripts and input files to run the solutions for that day's puzzle.
